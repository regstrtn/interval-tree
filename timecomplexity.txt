Time complexity of operations:

1. Construct Tree: O(nlogn)
	Where n is the number of elementary intervals

2. Insert into tree: O(n)
	Worst case is O(n), because in the worst case, the insertion algorithm may end up traversing each node of the tree

3. Interval Overlap: 
	O(h+k) where h is the height of the tree and k is the number of overlapping composers

4. Find Songs:
	O(h+k+M) where h is the height of the tree and M is the number of songs

5. Build IGraph: 
	O(n*(h+k)) #(h+k) could be of O(logn) in best case, or O(n) in worst case

6. Find largest possible team: O(V^2 * 2^V): 
	Brute force implementation requires checking for each possible subset of V
	Checking whether a subset is clique requires O(V^2) time

7. Find largest group (connected component): 
	O(V+E) Applying DFS to find connected component
